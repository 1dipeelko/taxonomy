Outlaw CM Edition is a plugin that automatically adjusts the gain of your audio signal based on a target level and a set of parameters. You can use it to control the loudness of your tracks, add some subtle compression, or even create some creative effects. Outlaw CM Edition works as a VST, VST3, AU, or AAX plugin on both Windows and Mac platforms, and supports 64-bit and 32-bit systems.
 
Outlaw CM Edition has a simple and intuitive interface that lets you adjust the following parameters:
 
- Target: The target level that the plugin tries to achieve.
- Sensitivity: How quickly the plugin reacts to changes in the input level.
- Attack: How fast the plugin increases the gain when the input level is below the target.
- Release: How fast the plugin decreases the gain when the input level is above the target.
- Output: The output level of the plugin.

You can also use the bypass button to compare the processed and unprocessed signals, and the meter to monitor the input and output levels. Outlaw CM Edition also has a handy preset menu that lets you choose from some common settings for different types of audio sources, such as vocals, drums, guitars, bass, and more.
